Pricing Behaviours
Firms adopt many different pricing strategies
Offer a variety of versions of products.
Rebates via an online code
Mac versions of software may be priced higher
Packets 50 cheques @ $1.13 each, 2000 cheques @ $0.13 each.
Envelopes & cheque combos priced lower than individual purchases of items
McAfee notes that American Airlines changes airfares � million times a day.



Pricing Behaviours
In each case the question is: 
Why?
The answer of course is pretty simple�..
Firms want to maximise profits and good pricing strategies is just one way to do this



Pricing Behaviours
Recall that in a competitive market price = MC
For price to exceed MC, firms must have market power, which means �.
Assume that firms price to maximise profits
Begin by considering the easiest problem, namely the choice of price or quantity to maximise profit in a single period - an innocuous assumption if the business environment is stationary. 
Pricing Behaviours
Profit maximisation for the firm with market power requires�.
Marginal revenue = Marginal cost
Note that such a strategy leaves some consumer surplus on the table

Single Price Monopolist � Classic Presentation
Pricing Behaviours
Limitations of such an approach
Everyone faces the same price which limits options and profits.
One product being sold
A single period problem
Strategic considerations re competing products � think about the Bertrand problem. Perhaps more challenging, think about a Bertrand problem when products are differentiated.

Profit maximising pricing
Note that from an economic perspective what is important for the pricing decision are incremental costs. Sunk costs should be irrelevant.
Stock might have been purchased at one price (say $18), but it is its replacement cost that is relevant for the pricing (say $10) decision.
In general as demand becomes less elastic the mark up over marginal cost becomes higher.
Recall: 
????=?? 1? 1 ?  =????

Profit maximising pricing
So: 
 ???? ?? = 1? 1 ?  
 ???? ?? =  ??1 ?  
 ?? ???? =  ? ??1  
  lim ????   ?? ???? = lim ????   ? ??1  =1 


Profit maximising pricing
That is, in the limit :
  ??=???? 
Of course this also means that the less elastic demand is the greater will be the mark-up over marginal cost.
Intuition�


Profit maximising pricing � rules of thumb
Cost plus-pricing - 
Idea here is to use ATC and then work up to yield an average rate of return. Consider �
Assume VC=$10 & FC=$100k and expected sales =75,000 and rtarget=0.2. Then: 
Unit cost	=????+ ???? ?????????? 
		=10+ 100000 75000 =$11.33


Profit maximising pricing � rules of thumb
So
??????????=  ???????? ????????  1????????????? ???????? ????????????  
	= 11.33 0.8 =$14.16
Of course such an approach would seem to go against the principles discussed above, namely..
Focusing on incremental cost and elasticity
But maybe it doesn�t if the guess is educated�
That is a higher target rate of return really just reflects an understanding or market power (or how elastic demand is).
Why might nonprescription drugs have a high mark-up and milk a low markup?
Hint: It really does reflect the elasticity of demand�. 
Profit maximising pricing � block pricing
Assume initially that the firm faces homogeneous consumers. Makes life substantially easier.
Block pricing � charge a different price per unit depending on the quantity purchased. 
Common example is that of clothes -  buy the first item at full price and get the second one for 50% off. Look around shops and there are many real world examples such as clothes,  wine, groceries.
Why does this work?



Profit maximising pricing � two part tariffs
Traditionally used by phone companies, electricity companies, golf clubs etc. Razor manufacturers also adopt this approach.
Fixed charge or access fee
Per unit charge. 
Again many real world examples
Consider the following very simple example when MC is constant�



Profit maximising pricing � two part tariffs
With heterogeneous consumers the problem becomes a little more complex.
Suppose we have two types of buyers � a high and low type.
If we set per unit price = MC, the best we can do is to set the fixed fee at the CS of the low type consumer.
In general, it will be better to set price higher than MC and set the fixed fee at the lower of the CS 


Profit maximising pricing � heterogeneous customers
Usually think about price discrimination or value based prices. That is prices unrelated to costs of production.
Requirements:
Customer heterogeneity
Some way of charging different customers different prices. Maybe because different customer types can be identified (1st or 3rd degree price discrimination), or, through 2nd degree price discrimination where customers effectively reveal type �
No arbitrage � this may or may not be simple both from a legal and practical point of view.


Profit maximising pricing � heterogeneous customers
Why might arbitrage be difficult or impossible?
Nature of item and transportation costs
Legal impediments to resale - drugs
Personalised prices � electricity generators
Thin markets � airline tickets at one point.
Informational problems


First degree price discrimination
Simply charge willingness to pay for each customer.
The challenge�?
Is it ever surmountable? 
Electricity utilities
Consider the Panama canal and the questions asked about size of ship, number of crew, the nature of the goods carried�. 
So what might we expect to happen following recent change in price of oil?
�Cheap Oil is Taking Shipping Routes Back to the 1800s� < http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160303-cheap-oil-is-taking-shipping-routes-back-to-the-1800s  > 



Third degree price discrimination
Group pricing or third degree price discrimination.
Simply separate the market into the appropriate number of groups � it doesn�t have to be two. Then behave like a monopolist (or more generally maximise profit as a single price monopolist) in each of the separate sub markets.
That is, set MR = MC in each of the separate markets
What types of items might this work best for?
How might you distinguish between different types or groups of buyers?


Third degree price discrimination
Can be used for many types of products inc. books (how?), clothes (how?) & haircuts
Might a firm face problems with such an approach?


Second degree price discrimination
Sometimes the problem is that you don�t really know who you are selling to � is it a local or a non-local, a senior citizen or a student� ?.
We want to charge different buyers different prices but there is a problem with this. If we ask people will do the sensible thing and �.
LIE!
Of course in other cases it might just simply be illegal to charge different prices to different groups.


Second degree price discrimination
So what to do?
Let customers choose, but in doing so make them an offer they cannot refuse.
We saw this everywhere� Stata Corporation offers at least 6 options for buyers of its software depending on size of software and whether one wants a perpetual or annual license.
Similarly, car manufacturers offer a range of models that are priced differently depending on the number of extras.



Second degree price discrimination
So how does it work?
Assume that each buyer buys one version of software and they choose the edition that gives them the greatest level of consumer surplus.
Consider the following valuations placed on tax software by different users. 
Consider why different types of buyers have different valuations and what they represent.
Assume,  just to keep life simple that the MC of production is zero



Second degree price discrimination


No consider different pricing options
PB=20 (for individuals) & PD=100 (for Self-employed)
PB=20 & PD=84
PB=20 & PD=86
PD=100
PB=20

Second degree price discrimination



No consider different pricing options
PB=20 & PD=100
Think about this as the ideal outcome in which the seller sold the software to each buyer at their valuation. In this case:
Individual buys the Basic & Self-employed buys the Deluxe.
Profits = $120 
Second degree price discrimination



No consider different pricing options
PB=20 & PD=84
Think about this as this as a menu that is presented to each potential buyer. In this case:
Individual buys the Basic & Self-employed buys the Deluxe.
Why?
Profits = $104 
Second degree price discrimination



No consider different pricing options
PB=20 & PD=86
Think about this as this as a menu that is presented to each potential buyer. In this case:
Individual buys the Basic & Self-employed buys the Basic.
Why?
Profits = $40 
Second degree price discrimination



No consider different pricing options
PD=100
Think about this as this as a menu that is presented to each potential buyer. In this case:
Individual buys nothing & Self-employed buys the Deluxe.
Why?
Profits = $100 
Second degree price discrimination



No consider different pricing options
PB=20
Think about this as this as a menu that is presented to each potential buyer. In this case:
Individual buys the Basic & Self-employed buys the Basic.
Why?
Profits = $40 
Second degree price discrimination
We can also think about menu pricing or second degree price discrimination using demand curves.
The key here is that the area under the demand curve represents the willingness to pay for individuals.
Again the key is to ensure that each individual purchases the appropriate (i.e. profit maximising) option.
Consider the following example.  

Second degree price discrimination



Second degree price discrimination
Suppose that two plans are offered � the budget (5 hours talk time per month) and deluxe (10 hours talk time) at prices of $25 for the budget and $50 for the deluxe.
Person A buys the budget, as does person B.
Why? 
Suppose that two plans are offered � the budget (5 hours talk time per month) and deluxe (10 hours talk time) at prices of $25 for the budget and $35 for the deluxe.
Person A buys the budget, and person B buys the deluxe.
Why? 
Profit maximising pricing � other strategies
So how else do you get people to pay more or give up more of their consumer surplus?
Rebates and coupons � why do they work and how do they work?
Examples�
Rebates offered to switchers � credit cards.


Profit maximising pricing � other strategies
How might you benefit from offering more than one product?
Think about what McDonalds, Microsoft and Foxtel have in common�bundling
The way to think about it is that you offer more than one object for sale, and demands or valuations differ across individuals 
Easy to show it can lead to higher profits. Assume we have MC=$10 for ease of exposition


Profit maximising pricing � Bundling




Now consider two different pricing options
PA = 40 & PT = 40
PB=100 � that is a bundle at $100 that includes both channels.

Profit maximising pricing � Bundling



Now consider two different pricing options
PA=40 & PT =40
In this case both Tony and Malcolm purchase each channel, so total revenue is $160 and profits are $120
PB=100 
In this case both Tony and Malcolm purchase the bundle, so total revenue is $200 and profits are $160


Profit maximising pricing � Bundling



Now consider optional or mixed bundling (Assume MC=AC=0)
PW = 90 & PSS= 90 (no bundling)
PBundle = 150 (bundling)
PBundle = 200,  PW = 120 & PSS = 120 (optional bundling)
Profit maximising pricing � Bundling



Now consider no bundling
PW = 90 & PSS= 90
Buyers of each product are circled
Profits = 540 = 270 + 270 = (3 x 90 )+(3 x 90 )
Profit maximising pricing � Bundling



Now consider bundling:
PBundle = 150 
Buyers of each product are circled
Profits = 600 = 4x150
Profit maximising pricing � Bundling



Now consider optional bundling
PW = 120,  PSS = 120 & PBundle = 200 
Buyers of each product are circled
Profits = 2 x 200 + (2 x 120) = 640
Profit maximising pricing � Other Strategies
Now consider some other strategies
Adobe makes its pdf reader freely available
Learning curve effects might mean that a lower price is acceptable on an order, even if it exceeds current MC
The current MC for computer chips is $2.50 but the firm believes its MC will fall to $2.00 after producing another 100k chips. Existing orders add up to 200k and an order is placed for 10k chips at $2.00. Should it accept the order even though the price < MC?
Yes, because the new order reduces future production costs in such a way so that the incremental cost of producing the order is $20, taking into account the future reduction in costs of $5000


Profit maximising pricing � Yield management
Discussion to this point has largely been static, but don�t live in a static world.
Airlines are the masters of changing prices over time � also works for services such as hotel rooms
Think about dynamic price discrimination, revenue management or yield management
Why dynamic? Because booking a ticket now precludes the option of  booking it later at a higher price. The flexibility or option value is lost when a ticket is booked.

Profit maximising pricing � Yield management
Goal yield management is to maximise willingness to pay.
Consider simple problem of how many seats to keep for higher paying business travelers who pay PF , a higher price than leisure or discount travelers (PD)
Qn: how many seats to �reserve for business travelers�, or put another way, when to stop selling discount seats?
Suppose q out of Q seats have been sold, so (Q � q) remain.
Should all additional passengers pay PF ?
Profit maximising pricing � Yield management
The math is set out in McAfee, but lets not focus on that too much�.
The key issue is that airlines must weigh up leaving some seats at a higher price and selling those passengers who are willing to pay a high price at the very last minute (such as business passengers), or simply selling seats at a low price and almost certainly filling up the plane with budget conscious (tourist) travelers.
Profit maximising pricing � Yield management
McAfee shows it is better to sell an additional discount fare if: 
????>   ?? ?? ? ?? ??    ?? ??  
Where n is the probability the next request comes from a leisure traveler; s is the probability the plane sells out;  ?? ??  is the price of a full priced ticket (think of it as a business ticket);  ?? ??  is the price of a discount ticket. 
You might think that ?? gets smaller as time to flight departure approaches and if so, then it makes it less likely that the expression above holds in which case the airline is better off NOT selling another discount fare. That is, they offer only full fares as the departure date fo the flight approaches.  

Price Dispersion - Sales
Last week we considered a models of sales.
We discussed sales in the context of game theory or strategic decision making.
In that case, we argued that by choosing a particular pricing rule the level of profits gained were independent of the price chosen and frequency of sales.
Given all firms followed the same rule, this meant that the firm could not change its behaviour (choose a different price or frequency of sales) to get higher profits.
Hence, there was no incentive for a firm to unilaterally change its behaviour so as to increase profits.

Price Dispersion - Sales
Consider sales model using the same principles (50 uninformed for each store and 120 informed buyers who only purchase if product is on sale).
Think about choice b/w everyday low pricing (NP) versus sales (SP).
Two pure strategy equilibria (assume SP=500, NP=600, cost=450). 

Price Dispersion - Sales
So what should each firm do? That is what mixed strategy is optimal? (DON�T WORRY ABOUT THE MATH HERE!!)
Let p(NP) be prob. charging normal price & let p(SP) be prob. charging sale price
p (NP) + p(SP) = p (NP) + [1- p(NP) ] = 1
Big W�s profit if it chooses the pure strategy of charging a sale price (SP ) while Target uses a mixed strategy:
EV (SP) = 8500pTarget (NP) + 5500pTarget (SP)
Suppose Big W chooses pure strategy of NP while Target uses a mixed strategy. This gives a payoff of 7500.
EV (NP) = 7500p (NP) + 7500p(SP)=7500
To identify mixed strategy equilibrium set payoffs for Big W under both pure strategies equal to each other:
EV (NP) = EV (SP) = 7500, or
pTarget(NP)(8500)+ pTarget(SP)(5500) = 7500	(i)


Price Dispersion - Sales
But note that:
pTarget (SP) + pTarget (NP)=1	(ii)
 Solving for (i) and (ii)
pTarget (SP)=1/3 & pTarget (NP)=2/3
 Note firms Target�s expected payoff:
EV (SP) = 1/3*(5500)+2/3*(8500) = EV1(stay out) = 7500
So applying the same approach to Target, the equilibrium strategy for Big W is 1/3 probability of having a sale, i.e. pBigW(SP)=1/3 & pBigW(NP)=2/3 .




Price dispersion� Strategic Considerations
So that if the two firms choose randomly to have a sale with these probabilities, then we can show that the other firm has no incentive to change its own behaviour�.
Implications? 
Arise from competition over informed and uninformed customers.
Don�t necessarily represent the beginnings of price war.
Causes prices to fluctuate randomly.
Have distributions that are stable over time


Where to next?
Next week we look at Product Differentiation.
