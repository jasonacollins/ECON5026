Value Creation � Transaction Costs
* Have not considered transactions costs so far � but yet they enter into almost every transaction between economic agents that we are concerned with.
* What are they? Think about them in this context as the cost of interacting with other economic agents � in this case the firm and its customers. There are many definitions and examples and will include: 
* Search costs for consumers
* Transport costs for buyers and sellers
* Costs of learning product characteristics 
* Costs of negotiating and drafting contract for sellers.
Why are they important?
* Consider the following supply and demand curve�.




Value Creation
* First question is � what is value?
* Simply think of it as the sum of producer and consumer surplus. 
* Net value to consumer is (wtp � price), i.e. CS.
* Similarly, net value to seller is (price � MC), i.e.  PS.
* Hence total value equals (wtp � MC), i.e. TS.
* It is important to note how to think about willingness to pay.
* For cons. - reflects utility derived from consumption of good/  service
* For business buyers it reflects the next best alternative � sugar versus corn syrup in soft drink production
* As we have already considered in the context of pricing, it is important to note that wtp will vary over buyers.

Value Creation
* How to create value?
* In the context of the demand and supply curve diagram above a firm could: 
* Lower production costs or producer TCs
* Reduce consumer TCs and shift the effective demand curve to the right
* Otherwise shift demand 
* Create new products

Value Creation
* Producer and production transaction costs
* Walmart and Amazon in their warehousing and distribution networks; minimizing inventory costs; airlines turn around planes more rapidly and thereby reduce costs 
* Consumer transaction costs
* Layout of stores; Amazon; Online booking for airline tickets; sellers offering try before you buy, thereby reducing the cost of identifying the product characteristics and quality
* Increasing demand
* Increasing product quality � with a caveat�.
* Pricing complements �.

Value Creation
* Consider what happens if firms can cooperate over complementary products � printers and computers, restaurant meals and movie tickets for example etc.
??=12 ?????????+????????
* Where this is the demand curve for each product.
* Keep in mind here that the goods are complements � how do we know this?
* Moreover, the maximum price for the two goods must be 12 (hopefully this is intuitively obvious). Finally assume MC=0.
* First consider the non-cooperative solution
* Identify each firms reaction function by choosing its price assuming the price of the other firms product is given.
?????????????????   ??????=?????????????????????

Value Creation
* This yields the following reaction functions (assuming zero MC).
???????=6?0.5???????
???????=6?0.5???????
* So we have two equations in two unknowns � the solution is the same as usual
* Prices and quantities for both firms are equal to 4.
* Note that in this case the profits are $16000 each or $32000 in total

Value Creation
* On the other hand, lets suppose that the firms either agree to jointly maximize profits, create a joint venture or in the extreme case actually merge into a single firm.
* Recall the demand curve and therefore the marginal revenue curve of the products.
* Demand: 			??=12???
* Marginal revenue: 		????=12?2??
* Now firms will set a combined price of $6 (???????=???????=2), sell 6000 units and make total profits of $36,000.
* What is really going on here in the absence of cooperation?
Diversification
* In general, so far we have focused on firms that produce a single good � but many businesses operate across markets.
* Why might this make sense?
* There may be economies of scope � when the total cost of producing  Q1 and Q2 together is less than the cost of producing them separately
* That is:
 ???????1?,0?+????0, ???2??>????? ???1?, ???2??
Diversification
* Why diversification potentially offers positive economies, there will also be costs.
* We shall consider some of these as we begin to discuss organisational structure in the next couple of weeks.
Product Differentiation
* Lets return to the original question, how might you create and capture value? 
* One strategy is product differentiation
* By making your self different or creating some uniqueness, i.e. offering a product no one else sells.
* By doing so you create some market power.
* Have already encountered this in the context of monopolistic competition and will build on that model.
* Note that this could come through market entry or it could come from creating a new product in an existing market


Product Differentiation
* Qn: How to differentiate? 
� Quality differentiation � think of this as what we described as vertical differentiation. Everyone agrees the product is better. 
� Variety � horizontal differentiation.
* Could think about horizontal differentiation as a choice over location � some people prefer to consume take-away closer to home ala Esme and Jose.







Product Differentiation
* So, when c is small, a change in price leads to a large change in demand..
* Think about this as the products being barely differentiated � they are close substitutes. 
* Qn: what is the profit maximising price?
* Keep in mind that share of customers for L is x*, so if we assume zero production costs the best price for L is to choose pL to maximise: 
?????????????=???????????????????????? ???????????????????

Product Differentiation
* Qn: what is the profit maximizing price?
???????=???+????????2?
* Why?	? ??????????????????    ???????0.5+?????????????????2??????
* FOC (for L): 	 0.5+?????????2??? ?????????????=0
* FOC (for R): 	 0.5+?????????2??? ?????????????=0
Product Differentiation
* Qn: what is the profit maximizing price?
???????=???+????????2?
* Implications:
� An increase in c which isolates L from R will lead to an increase in price
� An increase in ??????? will lead to an increase in ???????
* That is desired prices increase in both the amount of differentiation and the level of competitors prices but there is less than full pass on � an increase in the competitors prices is not fully passed on.
* Nonetheless, in the model above the Nash Equilibrium is that both firms charge c!
* Implication � firm profits increase in the degree of differentiation.
Product Differentiation � Endogenous location
* Now ask what the model looks like if we hold prices constant. In this case the model becomes one of location choice.
* Moving from L to R, this causes the marginal consumer to move from the L to the R.
* Similarly, the firms on the R will have an incentive to move to the L, causing the marginal consumer to move from the R to the L�.





Product Differentiation - Endogenous location
* Qn: where to the firms end up?
In the middle
* This is why it is claimed that many firms end up offering something similar.
* This reasoning is not just confined to firms, but also political parties who try to capture the middle ground.
* Hence, we see two candidates who are very similar�




Or maybe not ��.
Product Differentiation - Endogenous Location
* Note that this result applies for two firms but not for many. 
* Suppose that there were four firms and they were all in the middle.
* What do you think might happen?
Why?
* So what might the result end up looking like?



Product Differentiation - Endogenous location
* Consider what happens with four firms.
* Assume that if firms are located at the same point they end up splitting the market. See next weeks tutorial but we would expect in this case�




Product Differentiation - Endogenous Prices
* Qn: What happens when prices are adjustable along with firm location?
* When prices are flexible you want to be further away from your rivals.
* When firms choose best responses (for fixed location) the price was equal to set price equal to c � the transportation cost between the two locations. 
* The higher this distance is the greater is the price and the greater are the profits for each of the firms.
* The key constraint is that when you get further away from each other, what is likely to happen?
Product Differentiation - Endogenous Prices
* Qn: What does your location do to other firms price?
* Turns out that when you move further away from your competitor  you tend to increase your own price and also help your competitor.
* Why? 
* Intuitively, for the competitor, the competition is further away and it has a higher price!
* But then, the firm that moves away also gets a flow on benefit of the competitor raising its own price.
Product Differentiation - Endogenous Prices
* So what does this mean for the real world?
* McAfee identifies how an increase in legroom in one airline (American) was mostly copied by the others, but not all.
* LCCs didn�t match majors in increasing legroom, but they should be able to increase price as there was less competition in the budget space. 
* But American�s optimal response to the increase in prices by the LCCs was to itself increase prices by a smaller amount, etc etc
* See discussion in http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-big-three-airlines-are-so-much-the-same-1470850460 
Product Differentiation
* So what other patterns do we see?
* Turns out that similar firms often locate near each other:
* Fast food outlets. 
* Starbucks coffee outlets - 
* Car yards  - Parramatta Road
* Broadway
* Business conglomerate where the customers are and customers go to where the businesses are
* Sometimes there are complementarities in the products they sell such as on Broadway � people go there to see shows over the course of the year.
Product Differentiation
* The lesson here? 
* Sometimes maximum differentiation works, other times it doesn�t. 
Product Differentiation - Preemption
* Qn: How can you deter entrants and capture value by filling in the product space?
* Return to the Hotelling model or the location model but now consider a firm that offers or can offer a series of products.
* Moreover, assume that there is a fixed cost of entry to the market, ??.
* Qn: How far apart do two products have to be to deter or discourage entry from potential rivals?
* Note that here the model is really that of a circle, but don�t worry about the details �
Product Differentiation - Preemption
* Assume that there is a transport cost per unit of distance equal to  ?? and a distance between outlets or products is equal to ?? so the outlets price at c=????, i.e. the transport costs between the outlets.
* A new entrant would choose to locate midway between two existing firms � that is ????2? from the existing firms, thereby maximising their own product space. 

Product Differentiation - Preemption
* This would create transportation costs of ??=??????2?, that is the transport cost between each of its closest competitors.
* Qn: What are the entrants profits equal to?
* They equal the size of the market, ????2? , times the price which is simply equal to transport costs in this model (ignoring any other costs), ??=??????2?.
* So: 
???????=?1?4???2?????
Product Differentiation - Preemption
* So, this means it will be profitable for firms to enter as long as the fixed cost of entry to the market is less than profits earned: 
??<?1?4???2??
   Or
   ??>2??????????

Qn: So what does this mean?

Product Differentiation - Preemption
* The market could accommodate firms that are much closer together than the level where preemption or the strategic blocking of potential entrants, occurs.
* Why? Because at distance ??????????  firms just break even � at a distance twice that firms break even by entering and reducing the distance to ??????????
* Note: if d= ?????????? then the firm�s revenue is price ( which is just td or the transport cost between the two firms) times size of the market (which in this case is d (= ??????????). Hence:
Revenue = tdd=t(??????????)2 =F

Product Differentiation - Preemption
* Preemption can occur with fewer products than would be sold in a competitive equilibrium with zero profits � the intuition is that by preempting you �tie up� the available product space in such a way that after entry, the entrant is worse off than they would be in a competitive outcome, i.e. earning zero economic profits.

Product Differentiation - Preemption
* As fixed costs increase, the distance that preeempts entry also grows at a decreasing rate � increasing fixed costs may not be a good strategy. 
* Recall entry will be discouraged as long as:
??<2??????????
* While this grows as F grows, it grows at a decreasing rate. For example, if F increases from 16 to 64 (quadruples), the distance that discourages entry doubles

Product Differentiation - Preemption
* What types of fixed costs might act in this way to discourage entry?
* You might think that some regulations represent a fixed cost that increases the burden on an entrant � these have to be increased by a lot to discourage entry.
* Preemption � effectively filling the product space might be a better strategy particularly if its done at a low cost. What you do is effectively ensure that the distance between yourself and rivals is small enough to discourage entry.
* Moreover, in a dynamic sense it may provide opportunities for firms to generate reputations around response to the entry of new firms that discourages such actions.

Where to next?
* Next week we look start thinking about the firm, especially what a firm is, and what happens inside the firm.
